# CRUD-CSharp-and-MongoDB
Connecting a C# project to a MongoDB and using get, insert, update and delete commands

## Initial considerations
Before starting the application it is necessary to start your MongoDB and configure the DB.cs class to make the connection.

By default I am using localhost and port 27017 - "mongodb: // localhost: 27017" - and the configured collection is "contact_list"
